You are working at a retail company where sales data is collected daily and stored in an array. Your task is to develop a program that reads the daily sales figures from an array and determines the minimum and maximum sales made during a given period.
Input:
The input consists of two parts:
An integer nnn (1 ≤ nnn ≤ 1000) indicating the number of days for which sales data is available.
An array of nnn integers where each integer represents the sales figure for a particular day.
Output:
Print two integers in a single line separated by space:
The first integer should represent the minimum sales figure observed during the given period.
The second integer should represent the maximum sales figure observed during the given period.

ans= 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   int n;
   cout<<"Enter the number of days:";
   cin>>n;
   int sales[n];
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
       cin>>sales[i];
   }
   int min;
   int max;
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
   {
       if(sales[i]<min){
           min=sales[i];
       }
       if(sales[i]>max){
           max=sales[i];
       }
   }
   cout<<"minimum sales is:";
   cout<<min<<endl;
   cout<<"maximum sales is:";
   cout<<max;
   return 0;

}
